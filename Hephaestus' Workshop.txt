Librum Dentritis (Book of Gems) - In game book that describes the available gems.

"Machines"
•	Forge - Going to be what’s used for heating the metals for use on anvil. Multi Block
•	Anvil - Use heated metals to create tools and armor parts.
•	Blast furnace - Used to make steel and other metals. Multi Block
•	Grinder - Used to make dusts, VERY SLOW does not require fuel
•	Gem Setting Table - Used for creating gem tool heads or adding gems to existing tool heads

Metals
•	Tin - Soft metal used for alloys
•	Aluminium  - Soft metal used for alloys
•	Copper - Soft metal used for tools, armor, and alloys
•	Titanium - Strong metal used for tools, armor, and alloys (titanite)
•	Tungsten - Strong metal used for tools and armor after smelted in blast furnace
•	Silver - Weak metal used for tools, effective against endermen and the undead, slight fortune aspect
•	Sulphur - Dust like material used for creating extreme heat, used as fuel in forge and blast furnace
•	Lead - Heavy metal used in alloys

Gems
•	Citrine - yellow gem
•	Cubic Zirconia - light-teal
•	Jet - black gem
•	Olivine - green gem
•	Opal - pearl gem
•	Ruby - red gem
•	Sapphire - blue gem
•	Sun - yellow-orange gem
•	Topaz - orange gem
•	White Alabaster - white gem

•	*Diamond - teal gem
•	*Emerald - green gem
•	*Quartz - pearl gem

Alloys
•	Bronze - Above average metal used for tools and armor, created by mixing copper and tin (3:1) = 4
•	Heavy Iron - Strong metal used for tools and armor, created by mixing iron and lead (3:2) = 5
•	Steel - Strong metal used for tools and armor, created by smelting iron in the blast furnace
•	Hardened Iron - Strong metal used for tools and armor, created by smelting heavy iron in the blast furnace
•	Titanite - Very strong metal used for tools and armor, created by mixing titanium and aluminium (3:2) = 5
•	Titanium Carbide - Very strong metal used for tools and armor, created by smelting titanium in the blast furnace
•	Tungsten Carbide - Very strong metal used for tools and armor, created by smelting tungsten in the blast furnace

Armor
•	Shield - just a new armor piece that increases block effectiveness, may not do
•	Hephaestus' Mask
•	Hephaestus' Apron w/ gloves
•	Hephaestus' Pants
•	Hephaestus' Boots

Tools
•	Tongs - Used for picking up hot ingots created in the forge

Blocks
•	Ores
•	Storage Blocks
•	Half Blocks ?
•	Fences ?
•	Forge Brick ?
•	Blast Furnace Brick ?

Item
•	Tools/Weapons
•	Armor
•	Gems
•	Ingots
•	Dusts
•	Tool/Weapon heads
•	Handles ?

Recipes
•	Anvil - [xxx] [ x ] [yyy]   x=iron  y=logs   I shape with iron and logs
•	Forge - Multi block made out of clay brick blocks: 3x3x3
	~ [xxx] [xyx] [xxx], [xxx] [x x] [x x], [yxy] [x x] [yxy] x=brick block y=brick half block
•	Blast Furnace - Multi Block 3x3x4 two inside blocks hollow, bottom one is lava
	~ made out of TC smeltery bricks or unknown
•	Grinder - unknown
•	Gem Setting Table - unknown

Metal Working (Forge)
•	Uses Charcoal, Coal, and Sulphur for fuel
•	Charcoal/Coal - Heats most metals
•	Sulphur - Heats more advanced metals
•	May have a heat meter like the thermionic fabricator from Forestry
•	GUI: Similar to furnace, Slot for input, fuel, and output

Anvil
•	GUI: input, 2 output, and hammer slots Design grid 3x3 squares
•	Info Bar - Put the hammer and the tongs in and make the design on the grid, output and excess show up

Blast Furnace
•	GUI: 2 fuel slots an input and an output
•	Fuel is sulphur plus coal, NEED both for it to work
•	Can create steel and carbide

Grinder
•	GUI: an input and an output slot
•	No fuel but is VERY SLOW
•	It will double ores

Gem Setting Table
•	GUI: ???
