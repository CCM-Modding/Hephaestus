"Machines"
•	Forge ------------- Used for heating the metals for use on anvil. Multi Block
•	Anvil ------------- Used to create tools and armor parts.
•	Blast furnace ----- Used to make steel and other metals. Multi Block
•	Grinder ----------- Used to make dusts, VERY SLOW.
•	Gem Setting Table - Used for creating gem tool heads or adding gems to existing tools.
•	Alloy Table ------- Used for creating alloys.

Metals
•	Tin --------------- Soft metal used for alloys
•	Aluminium  -------- Soft metal used for alloys
•	Copper ------------ Soft metal used for tools, armor, and alloys
•	Titanium ---------- Strong metal used for tools, armor, and alloys (titanite)
•	Tungsten ---------- Strong metal used for tools and armor after smelted in blast furnace
•	Silver ------------ Soft metal used for tools, effective against endermen and the undead, slight fortune aspect
•	Sulphur ----------- Dust like material used for creating extreme heat, used as fuel in forge and blast furnace
•	Lead -------------- Heavy metal used in alloys

Gems
•	Citrine ----------- yellow gem
•	Cubic Zirconia ---- light-teal gem
•	Jet --------------- black gem
•	Olivine ----------- green gem
•	Opal -------------- pearl gem
•	Ruby -------------- red gem
•	Sapphire ---------- blue gem
•	Sun --------------- yellow-orange gem
•	Topaz ------------- orange gem
•	White Alabaster --- white gem

•	*Diamond ---------- teal gem
•	*Emerald ---------- green gem
•	*Quartz ----------- pearl gem

Alloys
•	Bronze ------------ Above average metal used for tools and armor, created by mixing copper and tin (3:1) = 4
•	Heavy Iron -------- Strong metal used for tools and armor, created by mixing iron and lead (3:2) = 5
•	Steel ------------- Strong metal used for tools and armor, created by smelting iron in the blast furnace
•	Hardened Iron ----- Strong metal used for tools and armor, created by smelting heavy iron in the blast furnace
•	Titanite ---------- Very strong metal used for tools and armor, created by mixing titanium and aluminium (3:2) = 5
•	Titanium Carbide -- Very strong metal used for tools and armor, created by smelting titanium in the blast furnace
•	Tungsten Carbide -- Very strong metal used for tools and armor, created by smelting tungsten in the blast furnace

Armor
•	Forge Master's Mask
    ~ optional may or may not do
•	Forge Master's Apron w/ gloves
    ~ needs special renderer, the apron needs to extend down more than the basic chest-plate
•	Forge Master's Pants
•	Forge Master's Boots

Tools
•	Tongs - Used for picking up hot ingots created in the forge

Blocks
•	Ores
•	Storage Blocks
•	Maybe some kind of container
•	Forge Brick ?
•	Blast Furnace Brick ?

Item
•	Tools/Weapons
•	Armor - some point in the future
•	Gems
•	Ingots
•	Dusts
•	Tool/Weapon heads
•	Handles

Recipes
•	Anvil - An "I" shape with iron and logs
    ~ [xxx] [ x ] [yyy] x=iron y=logs
•	Forge - Multi block made out of unknown: 3x3x3
    ~ [yxy] [x x] [yxy]
	~ [xxx] [x x] [x x]
	~ [xxx] [xxx] [xyx] x=block y=half block
	~ construction of Forge subject to change
•	Blast Furnace - Multi Block 3x3x4 two inside blocks hollow, bottom one is lava
    ~ made out of unknown
•	Grinder - unknown
•	Gem Setting Table - unknown

Metal Working (Forge)
•	Uses Charcoal, Coal, and Sulphur for fuel
•	Charcoal/Coal - Heats most metals
•	Sulphur - Heats more advanced metals
    ~ May have a heat meter like the thermionic fabricator from Forestry
•	GUI: Similar to furnace, Slot for input, fuel, and output

Anvil
•	GUI: input, 2 output, and hammer slot with arrows and a box to select the part to be made
    ~ put the hammer and the tongs in and select the part you would like to make, output and excess show up to be collected

Blast Furnace
•	GUI: 2 fuel slots an input and an output
•	Fuel is sulphur and coal, NEED both for it to work
    ~ can create steel and carbide

Grinder
•	GUI: an input and an output slot
•	Fuel - grind wheels
    ~ the material of the grind wheel decides what can be ground and how long it will last
    ~ it will double ores however it is very slow and should only be for early game use

Gem Setting Table
•	GUI: ???
    ~ used to great tool heads out of gems or add gems to created tools
	~ gem tool heads will have a low durability but tools with gems added will not have durability change
	~ gems will have/add a high mining level and break much easier than metal
	~ metal tools with gems added will have the gems break off before the tool itself breaks

Alloy Table
•	GUI: ???
    ~ used to mix different kinds of hot metal ingots together to create alloys
