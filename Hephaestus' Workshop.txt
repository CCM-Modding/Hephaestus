Hephaestus' Workshop

Forge Master's Notebook - In game book describing how all the blocks work and are made.

"Machines"
•	Forge ------------- Used for heating the metals for use on anvil/alloy table. Multi Block
•	Anvil ------------- Used to create tool and armor parts.
•	Blast furnace ----- Used to make more advanced materials. Multi Block
•	Grinder ----------- Used to make dusts, VERY SLOW.
•	Gem Setting Table - Used for creating gem tool heads or adding gems to existing tools.
•	Alloy Table ------- Used for creating alloys.

Armor
•	Forge Master's Mask
    ~ optional, may or may not do
•	Forge Master's Apron w/ gloves
    ~ needs special renderer, the apron needs to extend down more than the basic chest-plate

Tools
•	Tongs - Used for picking up hot ingots created in the forge

Blocks
•	Ores
•	Storage Blocks
•	Maybe some kind of container
•	Forge Brick ?
•	Blast Furnace Brick ?

Item
•	Tools/Weapons
•	Armor - some point in the future
•	Gems
•	Ingots
•	Dusts
•	Tool/Weapon heads
•	Handles

Recipes
•	Anvil - An "I" shape with iron and logs
    ~ [xxx] [ x ] [yyy] x=iron y=logs
•	Forge - Multi block made out of unknown: 3x3x3
    ~ [yxy] [x x] [yxy]
	~ [xxx] [x x] [x x]
	~ [xxx] [xxx] [xyx] x=block y=half block
	~ construction of Forge subject to change
•	Blast Furnace - Multi Block 3x3x4 two inside blocks hollow, bottom one is lava
    ~ made out of unknown
•	Grinder - unknown
•	Gem Setting Table - unknown

Metal Working (Forge)
•	Uses Charcoal, Coal, and Sulphur for fuel
•	Coal - Heats basic materials
•	Charcoal - Heats most materials
•	Sulphur - Heats more advanced materials
•	Blaze Powder - Heats more the most advanced materials
    ~ will need a heat meter like the thermionic fabricator from Forestry
•	GUI: Similar to furnace, Slot for input, fuel, and output

Anvil
•	GUI: input, 2 output, and hammer slot with arrows and a box to select the part to be made
    ~ put the hammer and the tongs in and select the part you would like to make, output shows up to be collected

Blast Furnace
•	GUI: 2 fuel slots an input and an output
•	Fuel is blaze powder/sulphur and charcoal, NEED both for it to work
    ~ is used for smelting more advanced materials into ingots and hardening other materials
    ~ for very heat resistant materials like stone or volcanic glass blaze powder is needed instead of sulphur

Grinder
•	GUI: an input and an output slot
•	Fuel - grind wheels
    ~ the material of the grind wheel decides what can be ground and how long it will last
    ~ it will double ores however it is very slow and should only be for early game use

Gem Setting Table
•	GUI: ???
    ~ used to great tool heads out of gems or add gems to created tools
	~ gem tool heads will have a low durability but tools with gems added will not have durability change
	~ gems will have/add a high mining level and break much easier than other materials
	~ tools with gems added will have the gems break off before the tool itself breaks

Alloy Table
•	GUI: ???
    ~ used to mix different kinds of hot metal ingots together to create alloys
