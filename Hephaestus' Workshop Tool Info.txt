Hephaestus' Workshop Tool Info

All tools need three durabilities.
1 - Tool Head
2 - Tool Handle
3 - Tool Modifier (gem accessory)

The head, handle, and modifier can break at different times.
-If the head breaks the modifier will break and the handle has a chance of breaking.
-If the modifier breaks the tool will simply loose the modifier without harming the other pieces.
-If the handle breaks the head will be fine but the modifier has a chance of breaking.
-If the handle breaks on a sharpened tool and the head does not there is a chance for the sharpness modifier to drop by 1-3

Also the tool head and handle can be repaired but only so many times depending on the material.

The tools can be placed into the grinder for sharpening with a chance to loose the tool.

-Swords and Axes will gain one level of the sharpness enchant each time they are sharpened. The max is 3.
